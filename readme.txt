Try the [PRO version of Products and Variations Visibility](https://1teamsoftware.com/product/woocommerce-products-visibility-pro/) for WooCommerce and take your product visibility control to the next level. 
With advanced rules and conditions, you can hide or display products based on flexible rules. 

You can also manage the visibility of matched and not matched products in the catalogue, hide product variations that match certain conditions from the product page, and hide or show products and variations by user role. 
Additionally, you can completely hide products from being accessed via URL or visible in a catalogue for all excluding particular user roles.

Advanced visibility rules enable you to achieve complex scenarios. 

Examples: 
* You can add a rule to hide all the products in a selected category, and then add another rule which will display selected products. 
* You can also define visibility for both matched and not matched products at the same time, which will enable you to achieve complex products or variations visibility scenarios. 
* Find multiple conditions that have to be matched for the visibility rule to be applied, such as hiding simple products from a selected category, with a specific attribute, tag, and shipping class.
